when the game starts (regular mode)

addition and playback: (one color button is randomly chosen and added to the series
the series is played back)

series count is displayed

the user is meant to repeat the series

if they do then repeat addition and playback function
if not then I'm notified that I messed up and it plays back the most recent series

if series count === 20 then the user wins and is notified, then the game restarts

when the game starts (strict mode)

all the same except a wrong move results in a loss and restarts
